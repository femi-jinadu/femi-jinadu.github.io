Hello there, I'm Obafemi  ![image](images/obiwan-removebg-preview.png){:width="40px"}
========
I'm a 4th year PhD candidate at [Karen Panetta's](https://www.karenpanetta.com/#about-overview) Vision Sensing and Simulation Lab at Tufts University, where I work on computer vision, multimodal machine learning and generative AI to address complex, real-world problems.


Research
--------
My research is centered on developing cutting-edge machine learning, and deep learning techniques for vision and multimodal understanding (vision-language), toward deploying reliable, robust, and trustworthy models that achieve state-of-art performance.

Personal & Course-based Machine Learning Adjacent Projects
------
* **My DDPM re-implementation** (Github Repository [here](https://github.com/Obafemi-Jinadu/Diffusion-models-re-implementations)). 
  <br>I re-implemented the paper [denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM)](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2020/file/4c5bcfec8584af0d967f1ab10179ca4b-Paper.pdf&ved=2ahUKEwj_t6yIs46GAxUUFVkFHV8RCssQFnoECBMQAQ&usg=AOvVaw3_txjfhqsg67acjkwqOuSf) from scratch. The repository explores the strengths and weaknesses of DDPMs along with some ablation studies.
* **VisionTransformer (ViT) Re-implementation from Scratch** (Github Repository [here](https://github.com/Obafemi-Jinadu/VisionTransformer-Re-Implementation-from-Scratch)). 
  <br> I re-implemented the paper [An Image is Worth 16x16 Words: Transformers for Image Recognition at Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.11929)from scratch. The repository explores the Vision Transformer Architecture in detail, mapping the theory into code and thus cementing my understanding of the components that make up this architecture. 
* **Probabilistic Model for Amur Tiger Re-identification** [my paper](files/Final_Project_Report(6).pdf) | [course website](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/cs/136/2023s/index.html)
<br>I developed an animal re-identification deep-learning model that classifies 107 amur tiger entities using a Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimation model to counter the overfitting challenge of traditional maximum likelihood estimation-based models with severely limited  and imbalanced training [data.](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05586) 
<br>Instructor comment: "very nice overall! Would be excited to talk more if you want to follow up on this project.

Hello there, I'm Obafemi  ![image](images/obiwan-removebg-preview.png){:width="40px"}
========
I'm a 3rd year PhD candidate at [Karen Panetta's](https://www.karenpanetta.com/#about-overview) Vision Sensing and Simulation lab at Tufts University. Where I work on deep learning, computer vision, and multimodal learning (vision-language models - VLM) and apply them across several domains namely animal conservation, intelligence transportation systems for incident detection, and image enhancement algorithms. 

Research
--------
My research is centered on developing cutting-edge machine learning, and deep learning techniques for vision and multimodal understanding (vision-language), toward deploying reliable, robust, and trustworthy models that achieve state-of-art performance.
